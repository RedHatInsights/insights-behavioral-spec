Feature: Upgrade Risks Prediction Data Engineering - test well known values

  Scenario: Check Data Engineering Service response with wrong endpoint
    Given The CCX Data Engineering Service is running on port 8000
     When I request the upgrade-risks-prediction endpoint in localhost:8000
     Then The status code of the response is 404

  Scenario: Check Data Engineering Service response with a valid parameter, but with an invalid value
    Given The CCX Data Engineering Service is running on port 8000
     When I request the cluster endpoint in localhost:8000 with path this-is-not-a-cluster-id/upgrade-risks-prediction
     Then The status code of the response is 422
