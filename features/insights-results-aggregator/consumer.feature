Feature: Consuming and processing results from Kafka broker


  Background:
    Given REST API service hostname is localhost
      And REST API service port is 8080
      And REST API service prefix is /api/v1
      And the database is named test
      And database user is set to postgres
      And database password is set to postgres
      And aggregator database is in initial state
      And Kafka broker is available
      And Kafka topic "ccx.ocp.results" is empty
     When database connection is established
      And I migrate aggregator database to latest version
      And I read current migration number from database
     Then I should see that migration #31 is returned
    Given Insights Results Aggregator service is started in background
     When I wait 5 seconds
