Feature: Ability to delete selected records

  Scenario: Clean up one old cluster should be visible
    Given the system is in default state
      And the database is named test
      And database user is set to postgres
      And database password is set to postgres
      And database connection is established
      And the database is empty
     When I prepare database schema
     Then I should find that all tables are empty
     When I insert following records into REPORT table
          | org_id | cluster                              | report | reported_at | last_checked_at |

      And I run the cleaner to display all records older than 90 days
