Feature: Checking responses from Insights Results Aggregator Mock service: endpoint to return cluster report


  Background:
    Given REST API service hostname is localhost
      And REST API service port is 8080
      And REST API service prefix is /api/insights-results-aggregator/v2


  @rest-api
  Scenario: Check if Insights Results Aggregator Mock service return correct cluster report with 7 rule hits without org. selector
    Given the system is in default state
     When I request report for cluster 34c3ecc5-624a-49a5-bab8-4fdc5e51a266
     Then The status code of the response is 200
      And The status message of the response is "ok"
      And The report should contain 7 rule hits
      And I should find following rule hits in cluster report
