Feature: Workloads page behavior in Insights Advisor menu on Hybrid Cloud Console

        Current way of presenting workload related recommendations is not good
        enough. As a customer using OCP Advisor I'd like to be able to consume
        Workload related recommendations grouped by namespaces. This means that
        new UX controls need to be added into Insights Advisor: it would split
        results of DVO recommendations per namespace and display it to end
        users. Notifications should also be sent per namespace (which would
        enable developers to gain access to results per namespace they own).

        Workload related recommendations should be displayed on page named
        Workloads. Entry point to this page is available through the Advisor
        menu displayed in the left menu of Hybrid Cloud Console.

        The UX design for page that use these information is available there:

  Scenario: Existence of new tab named "Workloads" in Insights Advisor that is accessible through Hybrid Cloud Console menu
    Given user USER1 is part of account (organization) ACCOUNT1
      And account (organization) ACCOUNT1 owns 1 cluster
      And the user USER1 is already logged in into Hybrid Cloud Console
     When user looks at Hybrid Cloud Console main page
     Then menu on the left side should be displayed
      And the left menu might contain these top level items
